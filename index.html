	<h1>My Development Environment</h1>
    	<p>I'm still pretty new to all of this, so I think that I keep it pretty simple. My first class on anything html was taught to me through Adobe Dreamweaver, so for a while that was all I really knew. I didn't even know there were a lot of other viable options out there. I recently went through a phase where I tried out Aptana, but I ultimately decided that wasn't for me, and have switched back to Dreamweaver. I'm always open to trying different programs, but Dreamweaver was here first and I'll probably always find my way back to it.<br /><br />
        As for browsers, I've used Internet Explorer (those were dark times), Firefox, and Google Chrome. Chrome is definitely my favorite of the 3 and what I use the most. Firefox is a nice backup when Chrome is giving me issues, which hardly ever happens.<br /><br />
        I've never even heard of Git before until this class, and so far I've found it pretty confusing. I can definitely see the usefulness of it though, and I'm going to try and become more comfortable with it so I can continue to use it in the future.</p>
    <h1>How I Work On Web Development</h1>
    	<p>I begin my process with A LOT of procrastination. No, but seriously. I will get a great idea for an assignment or project and then put it off until the last second. It's a problem, but it's my problem. On the off chance that I make it past this stage, I like to do a few things. Mostly, I work best when I have a list of what I need to do. I'm nothing if not organized.
        <ul id="nav">
        	<li>Normally, I start out by putting on some sort of <a href="www.8tracks.com">playlist</a>. I like to listen to instrumental stuff mostly while I'm working; it keeps me focused. Movie/video game soundtracks are what I lean towards on most days.</li>
            <li>I always make a list of what my content is going to include in a journal.</li>
            <li>Then, I sketch a couple different layouts for what the site will actually look like.</li>
            <li>From here, I create the color scheme that I'm going to use, and I figure out which elements are going to be what.</li>
            <li>Beginning the actual coding process, I start with a simple skeleton of my html with filler text. I get everything organized where I want it to be.</li>
            <li>To finish it off, I work with css (and javascript if I have to, which I hope I rarely have to, because I hate it) to polish everything and make sure that it has the aesthetic that I want it to have.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
